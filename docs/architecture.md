# NexusAI Architecture Documentation

## Overview

NexusAI is a modern AI chat application built with React and TypeScript. The application supports multiple AI providers, offers a responsive user interface, and includes various features for managing conversations and settings.

This document provides an overview of the application's architecture, key components, and design patterns.

## Architecture Overview

NexusAI follows a component-based architecture with a global state management system. The architecture is designed to be:

- **Modular**: Components are self-contained and reusable
- **Extensible**: Easy to add new AI providers or features
- **Maintainable**: Clear separation of concerns
- **Performant**: Code-splitting and lazy loading for optimal performance

### Key Architectural Patterns

1. **Component Composition**: Breaking UI into reusable components
2. **State Management**: Using Zustand for global state
3. **Provider Pattern**: For AI services and application settings
4. **Factory Pattern**: For creating AI provider instances
5. **Template Method Pattern**: For standardized AI provider implementations
6. **Lazy Loading**: For code splitting and improved performance

## Core Components

### State Management

The application uses Zustand for state management, with two main stores:

1. **AppStore** (`src/store/app-store.ts`): Manages conversations, messages, and application state
2. **SettingsStore** (`src/store/settings-store.ts`): Manages user settings and preferences

These stores are implemented with immutable updates using Immer for better performance and developer experience.

### AI Provider System

The AI provider system is designed to support multiple AI services with a unified interface:

1. **Factory**: `AIProviderFactory` dynamically creates appropriate provider instances
2. **Base Class**: `BaseAIProvider` defines common provider functionality
3. **Provider Implementations**: Each AI service has its own implementation
4. **Error Handling**: Centralized error handling with standardized responses

### Component Structure

Components are organized hierarchically:

1. **Layout Components**: App-wide structure (sidebar, main content)
2. **Feature Components**: Specific features (chat, settings)
3. **UI Components**: Reusable UI elements (buttons, inputs)
4. **Composition Components**: Combine smaller components into features

## Data Flow

1. **User Input**: User interactions trigger actions in the UI components
2. **State Updates**: Actions update the global state via store functions
3. **AI Processing**: User messages are sent to AI providers
4. **UI Updates**: State changes trigger UI updates via React hooks

```

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Multiple AI Provider Support

The application supports multiple AI providers through a common interface. This is implemented using:
- A common `AIProvider` interface
- A base `BaseAIProvider` abstract class
- Provider-specific implementations
- A factory to create appropriate instances

This design allows for easy addition of new providers and ensures a consistent API for the application.

### 2. Code Splitting and Lazy Loading

The application uses code splitting and lazy loading to improve performance:
- Dynamically importing AI provider modules
- Lazy loading settings panels
- Lazy loading file preview components

This approach reduces the initial bundle size and improves application load time.

### 3. Error Handling

A comprehensive error handling system is used throughout the application:
- Centralized error categories
- User-friendly error messages
- Consistent error handling patterns
- Error boundaries for UI resilience

### 4. State Management

The application uses Zustand with Immer for state management:
- Immutable updates for predictable state changes
- Selector functions to minimize re-renders
- Structured state organization
- Persistent settings storage

## Extending the Application

### Adding a New AI Provider

1. Create a new provider implementation in `src/lib/ai/providers/`
2. Implement the `AIProvider` interface
3. Add the provider to the factory in `src/lib/ai/factory.ts`
4. Add provider models to `src/lib/ai/models.ts`
5. Add provider-specific settings if needed

### Adding New Features

1. Create new components in the appropriate directory
2. Update state management as needed
3. Add settings for the feature if appropriate
4. Update the UI to include the new feature

## Performance Considerations

1. **Memoization**: Components use `React.memo` and `useMemo` to prevent unnecessary re-renders
2. **Code Splitting**: Lazy loading reduces initial bundle size
3. **Selective Re-rendering**: Zustand selectors minimize component updates
4. **Efficient State Updates**: Immer enables efficient immutable updates
5. **Resource Cleanup**: Components properly clean up resources to prevent memory leaks

## Security Considerations

1. **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated
2. **Content Sanitization**: Message content is sanitized to prevent XSS attacks
3. **API Key Security**: API keys are stored securely and not persisted in application state
4. **Injection Prevention**: Checks for SQL, prompt, and XSS injection patterns
